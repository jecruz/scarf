## Requirements

- macOS 26.2+
- Xcode 26.3+
- [Hermes agent](https://github.com/hermes-ai/hermes-agent) v0.6.0+ installed at `~/.hermes/`

### Compatibility

Scarf reads Hermes's SQLite database (schema v6) and parses CLI output from `hermes status`, `hermes doctor`, `hermes tools`, `hermes sessions`, `hermes gateway`, and `hermes pairing`. Tested and verified against:

| Hermes Version | Status |
|----------------|--------|
| v0.6.0 (2026-03-30) | Verified |
| v0.6.0 (2026-03-31, latest) | Verified |

If a Hermes update changes the database schema or CLI output format, Scarf may need to be updated. Check the [Health](#features) view for compatibility warnings.

## Install

### Pre-built Binary (no Xcode required)

Download the latest universal binary (Apple Silicon + Intel) from [Releases](https://github.com/awizemann/scarf/releases):

1. Download `Scarf-vX.X.X-Universal.zip`
2. Unzip and drag **Scarf.app** to Applications
3. On first launch, right-click and choose **Open** (or go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway)

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awizemann/scarf.git
cd scarf/scarf
open scarf.xcodeproj
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
xcodebuild -project scarf/scarf.xcodeproj -scheme scarf -configuration Release -arch arm64 -arch x86_64 ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO build
```

## Architecture

Scarf follows the **MVVM-Feature** pattern with zero external dependencies beyond SwiftTerm:

```
scarf/
  Core/
    Models/       Plain data structs (HermesSession, HermesMessage, HermesConfig, etc.)
    Services/     Data access (SQLite reader, file I/O, log tailing, file watcher)
  Features/       Self-contained feature modules
    Dashboard/    System overview and stats
    Insights/     Usage analytics and activity patterns
    Sessions/     Conversation browser with rename, delete, export
    Activity/     Tool execution feed with inspector
    Projects/     Agent-generated project dashboards with widget rendering
    Chat/         Embedded terminal via SwiftTerm with voice controls
    Memory/       Memory viewer and editor
    Skills/       Skill browser by category
    Tools/        Toolset management per platform
    Gateway/      Messaging gateway control and pairing
    Cron/         Scheduled job viewer
    Logs/         Real-time log viewer
    Settings/     Structured config editor
  Navigation/     AppCoordinator + SidebarView
```

### Data Sources

Scarf reads Hermes data directly from `~/.hermes/`:

| Source | Format | Access |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `state.db` | SQLite (WAL mode) | Read-only |
| `config.yaml` | YAML | Read-only |
| `memories/*.md` | Markdown | Read/Write |
| `cron/jobs.json` | JSON | Read-only |
| `logs/*.log` | Text | Read-only |
| `gateway_state.json` | JSON | Read-only |
| `skills/` | Directory tree | Read-only |
| `hermes chat` | Terminal subprocess | Interactive |
| `hermes tools` | CLI commands | Enable/Disable |
| `hermes sessions` | CLI commands | Rename/Delete/Export |
| `hermes gateway` | CLI commands | Start/Stop/Restart |
| `hermes pairing` | CLI commands | Approve/Revoke |
| `.scarf/dashboard.json` | JSON (per-project) | Read-only |
| `scarf/projects.json` | JSON (registry) | Read/Write |

The app opens `state.db` in read-only mode to avoid WAL contention with Hermes. Management actions (tool toggles, session rename/delete/export) go through the Hermes CLI.

### Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm) | Terminal emulator for the Chat feature |

Everything else uses system frameworks: SQLite3 C API, Foundation JSON, AttributedString markdown, SwiftUI Charts, GCD file watching.

## How It Works

Scarf watches `~/.hermes/` for file changes and queries the SQLite database for sessions, messages, and analytics. Views refresh automatically when Hermes writes new data.

The Chat tab spawns `hermes chat` as a subprocess in a pseudo-terminal, giving you the full interactive CLI experience with proper ANSI rendering. Sessions persist across navigation — switch tabs and come back without losing your conversation.

Management actions (renaming sessions, toggling tools, editing memory) call the Hermes CLI or write directly to the appropriate files, keeping Scarf and Hermes in sync.

The app sandbox is disabled because Scarf needs direct access to `~/.hermes/` and the ability to spawn the Hermes binary.

## Project Dashboards

Project Dashboards turn Scarf into a customizable monitoring hub for all your projects. You define a simple JSON file in your project folder describing what to display — stat boxes, charts, tables, progress bars, checklists, rich text, and embedded web views — and Scarf renders it as a live-updating dashboard. Your Hermes agent can generate and maintain these dashboards automatically.

### What You Can Build

- **Development dashboards** — test coverage, build status, open issues, sprint progress
- **Data project trackers** — pipeline metrics, data quality scores, processing throughput
- **Deployment monitors** — deploy history tables, uptime stats, error rate charts
- **Research dashboards** — experiment results, key findings, paper status checklists
- **Agent activity views** — cron job results, content generation stats, task completion rates
- **Embedded web apps** — local dev servers, HTML reports, Grafana dashboards, any web-based tool your agent generates
- **Any project status** — if your agent can measure it, Scarf can display it

### Quick Start

**1. Create the dashboard file**

Create `.scarf/dashboard.json` in any project folder:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "title": "My Project",
  "description": "Project status at a glance",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Overview",
      "columns": 3,
      "widgets": [
        {
          "type": "stat",
          "title": "Test Coverage",
          "value": "87%",
          "icon": "checkmark.shield",
          "color": "green",
          "subtitle": "+2.1% this week"
        },
        {
          "type": "progress",
          "title": "Sprint Progress",
          "value": 0.73,
          "label": "73% complete",
          "color": "blue"
        },
        {
          "type": "list",
          "title": "Tasks",
          "items": [
            { "text": "Write unit tests", "status": "done" },
            { "text": "Update API docs", "status": "active" },
            { "text": "Deploy to prod", "status": "pending" }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Register your project**

In Scarf, go to **Projects** in the sidebar and click the **+** button to add your project folder. Or have your agent add it directly to the registry at `~/.hermes/scarf/projects.json`:

```json
{
  "projects": [
    { "name": "my-project", "path": "/Users/you/Developer/my-project" }
  ]
}
```

**3. View in Scarf**

Select your project in the Projects sidebar — the dashboard renders immediately. Scarf watches the file for changes and refreshes automatically whenever the JSON is updated.

### Widget Types

| Type | Description | Key Fields |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `stat` | Key metric with large value display | `value`, `icon`, `color`, `subtitle` |
| `progress` | Progress bar with label | `value` (0.0–1.0), `label`, `color` |
| `text` | Rich text block | `content`, `format` ("markdown" or "plain") |
| `table` | Data table with headers | `columns`, `rows` |
| `chart` | Line, bar, or pie chart | `chartType`, `series` (each with `name`, `color`, `data`) |
| `list` | Checklist with status indicators | `items` (each with `text`, `status`: done/active/pending) |
| `webview` | Embedded web browser | `url`, `height` (default 400) |

The `webview` widget embeds a live web browser directly in your dashboard — perfect for displaying local dev servers, HTML reports, or any web-based tool your agent generates.

When a dashboard includes a webview widget, Scarf adds a tabbed interface: **Dashboard** shows your normal widgets, **Site** shows the web content full-canvas with clean margins — using the entire available space in the app. This gives you the best of both worlds: compact metrics at a glance, and a full embedded browser when you need it.

```json
{
  "type": "webview",
  "title": "Project Report",
  "url": "http://localhost:8000/dashboard",
  "height": 500
}
```

- `url`: Any URL — typically a local server (`http://localhost:...`) or file path
- `height`: Height in points when displayed as an inline widget card (default: 400). The Site tab always uses full available space regardless of this setting.

**Colors**: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, teal, indigo, mint, brown, gray

**Icons**: Any [SF Symbol](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) name (e.g., `checkmark.shield`, `cpu`, `doc.text`, `chart.bar`)

### Agent-Generated Dashboards

The real power is letting your Hermes agent build and update dashboards automatically. Add instructions like this to your agent's context:

> Analyze this project and create a `.scarf/dashboard.json` dashboard with relevant metrics and status. Use stat widgets for key numbers, charts for trends, tables for structured data, lists for task tracking, and a webview widget if the project has a local web server or HTML reports. Register the project in `~/.hermes/scarf/projects.json` if not already registered.

Your agent can update the dashboard as part of cron jobs, after builds, or whenever project state changes. Since Scarf watches the file, updates appear in real-time.

### Dashboard Schema Reference

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "title": "Required — dashboard title",
  "description": "Optional — subtitle text",
  "updatedAt": "Optional — ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section Name",
      "columns": 3,
      "widgets": [{ "type": "...", "title": "..." }]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each section defines a grid with 1–4 columns. Widgets flow left-to-right, wrapping to new rows. See [DASHBOARD_SCHEMA.md](scarf/docs/DASHBOARD_SCHEMA.md) for the full schema reference with examples of every widget type.
