## Requirements

- macOS 26.2+
- Xcode 26.3+
- [Hermes agent](https://github.com/hermes-ai/hermes-agent) installed at `~/.hermes/`

## Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awizemann/scarf.git
cd scarf/scarf
open scarf.xcodeproj
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
xcodebuild -project scarf/scarf.xcodeproj -scheme scarf -configuration Debug build
```

## Architecture

Scarf follows the **MVVM-Feature** pattern with zero external dependencies beyond SwiftTerm:

```
scarf/
  Core/
    Models/       Plain data structs (HermesSession, HermesMessage, HermesConfig, etc.)
    Services/     Data access (SQLite reader, file I/O, log tailing, file watcher)
  Features/       Self-contained feature modules
    Dashboard/    System overview and stats
    Sessions/     Conversation browser with detail view
    Activity/     Tool execution feed with inspector
    Chat/         Embedded terminal via SwiftTerm
    Memory/       Memory viewer and editor
    Skills/       Skill browser by category
    Cron/         Scheduled job viewer
    Logs/         Real-time log viewer
    Settings/     Configuration display
  Navigation/     AppCoordinator + SidebarView
```

### Data Sources

Scarf reads Hermes data directly from `~/.hermes/`:

| Source | Format | Access |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `state.db` | SQLite (WAL mode) | Read-only |
| `config.yaml` | YAML | Read-only |
| `memories/*.md` | Markdown | Read/Write |
| `cron/jobs.json` | JSON | Read-only |
| `logs/*.log` | Text | Read-only |
| `gateway_state.json` | JSON | Read-only |
| `skills/` | Directory tree | Read-only |
| `hermes chat` | Terminal subprocess | Interactive |

The app **never writes** to `state.db` — it opens in read-only mode to avoid WAL contention with Hermes.

### Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm) | Terminal emulator for the Chat feature |

Everything else uses system frameworks: SQLite3 C API, Foundation JSON, AttributedString markdown, GCD file watching.

## How It Works

Scarf is a passive observer. It watches `~/.hermes/` for file changes and polls the SQLite database for new sessions and messages. The Chat tab spawns `hermes chat` as a subprocess in a pseudo-terminal, giving you the full interactive Hermes CLI experience with proper ANSI rendering.

The app sandbox is disabled because Scarf needs direct access to `~/.hermes/` and the ability to spawn the Hermes binary.
